Volunteering is a great opportunity for us to help other people and learn more the world around us. It helps us improve our interpersonal and intrapersonal skills. For me, I have been spending 10 - 20% of my time on volunteering activities each year since I started my undergraduate degree in late 2017. Therefore, I helped many students that I met and earned pieces of knowledge across various domains such as marketing, management, leadership, content writing, and so forth. Early this year, I joined the [Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/) program and involved many activities in [Microsoft Student Accelerator](https://www.facebook.com/msaaussie/) program in Australia that engage and help students learn more about Microsoft Cloud services. I learned many things during the journey. Thus, I would like to share them in this post.

## 1. Motivation

Last year, I attended the Microsoft Student Accelerator (MSA) program in Australia and fortunately was in top 3 students who had the highest score for the entire program - I have posted this on [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hung-du_msa2020-microsoft-iot-activity-6741933669176504320-R7If). I felt honour when receiving the prizes from Microsoft and learned many things via this program. The program also opened an opportunity for me to discover the Microsoft Student Learn Ambassadors (MLSA) program that expands my network to the MLSA community and allows me to learn more from others within the community. Therefore, I decided to become a member in the MSA program who supports to organise the program on early March. As the initial goal when joining the MSA program, I aim to virtually help students learn more about Microsoft cloud technology. Additionally, I want to learn more from my fellow ambassadors.

## 2. Activities and Milestones

In 6 months, I have involved in many different parts of the MSA program such as marketing, technical support, hosting workshop, and being a speaker. I briefly describe the activities and different milestones of each part below.

__Marketing:__ I joined the marketing team with the social lead role that leads the social media team to manage the social engagement via content and Q&A sessions. Here, I provided tips on how to do social media campaign and different strategies to keep students' engagement in the program via my prior experience. Not only suggesting plans and actions, but I also involved in the process of making various type of content such as Call for Action (CFA) content, informative content and persuasive content, and helping the media team to make posters for each workshop. You can find the Facebook page of the program at [this link](https://www.facebook.com/msaaussie/). Regarding this part of the program, we attracted more than 1000 students across many states in Australia participating in the program. Furthermore, we achieved the highest reach, engagements and page visits for 1 - 2 months after the program launched on March. In addition, we obtain the quickest response time in each Q&A session.

__Hosting Bootcamp:__ I joined the technical team, especially the Artificial Intelligence (AI) team, with the team lead role that works together with other member to host the AI Bootcamp which introduces students fundamentals concepts about AI and the integration between Azure Cloud and AI-related activities. Here, we brainstormed how the bootcamp would be organised such that it brings the most value to students, prepared presentations, created a story-like flow, went live and offered support via Q&A sessions. As it was a first time when I and my team hosted the bootcamp, we learned many different things along the journey. This includes the way that we create a story-like flow between three presentations, going live with Microsoft Teams, interacting with students, and marking prototypes. I'm proud of my team because they did an excellent job to make the bootcamp go through effectively and successfully. You can find the recordings for the first workshop at [https://aka.ms/msaai2021](https://aka.ms/msaai2021) and the second workshop at [https://aka.ms/msaml2021](https://aka.ms/msaml2021)

__Speaker:__ I'm one of the speakers in the AI bootcamp who presented the fundamental concepts about AI and how the end-to-end AI solution can be implemented in real-world. In this regard, I come up with many different ideas, chosen the best idea, prepared the presentation such that the flow is consistent, and the content is digestible for either non-technical or technical students, rehearsed the presentation, and went live. It was an exciting experience for me because I first time went live in such a big workshop which had around 60 students. I feel honour and passionate about presenting my best knowledge about AI to many students so that they can leverage AI technology to build solutions that bring good social impacts. During the journey, I learned to prepare and present the content in such a way that both non-technical and technical students can understand. You can find my presentation below.

## 3. Achievement

During the journey, I learned and experienced many things that I hadn't done before. I connect to more fellow ambassadors who are passionate about sharing knowledge with the community. I feel happy because I can see the contribution that I and my team brought for students in Australia regarding the education aspect of building the end-to-end AI solutions. Aside from these, I feel honour when I got the promotion to the Beta level in the MLSA program with the Microsoft Swag Kit as can be seen below.
