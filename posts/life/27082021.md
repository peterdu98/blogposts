title: Productivity Applications for My Daily Life
summary: Productivity is measured by the number of activities that you have done for a certain task and the outcomes that you gain from that task. Being more productive is equivalent to getting more done with the same or less efforts. Google Calendar, Notion, Microsoft applications, Kindle, Goodreads, Lucidchart and Excalidraw are applications that support me to be more productive daily.

"How can I be more productive?" is one of the frequent questions that we ask ourselves either at work or in our daily life. According to OCED [2], productivity is measured by the number of activities that you have done for a certain task and the outcomes that you gain from that task. As Jason Jennings mentioned in his book [1], being more productive is equivalent to getting more done with the same or less efforts. Hence, we need strategies with the help of digital technology to boost our daily productivity. In this post, I share digital applications that I use daily for managing tasks and boosting my productivity.

## 1. Time and Task Management
![](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4mzNOLZ0lgDBQca1Zq7KUpZkxEUaJd_vrcv6lOejev8nId1SCJxCF-37eP5dq74lcofsefpt2lLAq8rF5Mit0WmfaEtEmgHqLfusWpuoAtBjSRibTYYSC3FHOC-rOztSC-0oUe9xw1wXPtgtVMC6pun3A9YtrM_tgmoyCiY4mg2kmOw8dmyA2vrayhZrdS489v?width=1474&height=268&cropmode=none)

Time and tasks are two important that we need to manage well during the process of building the productivity pipeline. 

To manage my time effectively, I use __Google Calendar__ and the calendar in __Microsoft Outlook__. While __Google Calendar__ helps me plan and manage time for my personal activities or events, Outlook helps me keep track of meeting schedules at work. Furthermore, I tend to use __Google Calendar__ to plan what I'm going to do for the entire week. By doing so, I feel less procrastinated on thinking what I should do during the day and more productive on what I was planning to do within that day. Furthermore, I can reduce the time drain for a particular task because I can easily control my time with __Google Calendar__.

For task management, I use the timeline board provided by __Notion__. While I'm using __Google Calendar__ to allocate time for a particular task, I write down small and achievable action items for that task in __Notion__. The tag feature in __Notion__ is also great because it helps me to classify tasks into the defined categories such as _work_, _research_, _study_, _personal_, and _volunteer_. By looking at the timeline board in __Notion__, I can realise which category of task that I will need to do the most during the week. This sometimes helps me balance the amount of time and the number of tasks that I need to do among multiple categories (e.g., _work_ and _personal_). Not only task management for my daily life, but __Notion__ is also a place where I can manage tasks for my personal project(s), especially ones with collaboration. Here, I can assign a task to a particular person in my team and set the notification for the deadline of that task on the timeline board. Thus, __Notion__ is a great application for task management in both individual and collaborative ways.


## 2. Reading
![](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4mFPyE1YdbzI-P7UbZ8JDze7qCfb2hxC3LQXKpM6uRb1gG1dWw97dlyV4HFAxkNFtsR6D_yHispTlQOlC4OgscZkEyHkkoQZOfYtLo_GySc5R1RF7marFoO4R0WhW6WdBwShUw_zXrZFoBO_1oljw20XmOdw2pka4FHQzQaHPMl0-1nB9Q-0xd0MUxDGOvoCR0?width=1474&height=268&cropmode=none)

Reading becomes one of the important activities in my daily life. I spend most of my time on reading research articles, technical blogs and books every day. Thus, having applications that support me to highlight and take notes while reading comes to handy. In this regard, I used __Goodreads__, __Kindle__, and __Notion__ applications. 

I read books on my mobile __Kindle__ app which have many handy features for reading such as highlighting, taking notes, dictionary, lighting adjustment and others. Once I highlight a key point or take a note during reading, those highlights and notes will be automatically synced to my Goodreads account as well as my other devices such as iPad and laptop. With this, I don't need to worry about forgetting key points and notes that I made on a particular book. In addition, I can export those highlights and notes for my personal use. With __Goodreads__, I can also see public highlights and notes on a particular book from other readers. This helps me understand more about that book via others' thoughts.

As mentioned above, __Notion__ has an excellent feature which allows me to add tag on cards. I used this feature to classify exported highlights and notes from a particular book so that I will be able to easily search for it. While reading research papers, I tend to highlight and take notes on the PDF files. However, summarising the concepts of a particular research paper on the PDF file is not quite convenient. Therefore, I use __Notion__ for this purpose. Of course, I'm also able to add tag(s) to group those research papers into multiple categories. Then, I can use the full-text search in __Notion__ to instantly search for materials that I want to retrieve. This makes me feel more productive and effective during each reading session.

## 3.Note Taking, Bookmarking and Visualisation
![](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4mps63coMuL60jttk8gvpV0MD8B_jJdEzabEZhIdhKlJ3oNx0uKBJ47m-_9ypx_04Y8pjNZVLhNzarKbv-NiDf4Wwb5uUvzf_q2taOiHeOmkq_qaFoEVZhpbsnnbkZ_lSHBQhKyLzxKoMPs1kQPRB-YnO05pF65JWZAaHud3q6KkH1-ueXnX5G4LGgPqurifun?width=1474&height=268&cropmode=none)

Taking notes, bookmarking valuable resources and visualising concepts are the frequent activities either while either working or studying. The more I read, the more concepts I want to bookmark and clearly explain them to other people. Thus, having applications supporting these activities makes me feel more productive. 

I tend to use __Notion__ for taking notes and bookmarking useful materials that supports my work. Of course, I use the tag feature to group the information. In addition, for each note, I create a table of content so that I can easily wrap the information when needed.

If the concept is too complex to understand via notes, I tend to use __Lucidchart__ and __ExcaliDraw__ to symbolise it via diagrams. While __Lucidchart__ provides a professional look about the architecture or the diagram for a complex concept, __ExcaliDraw__ offers a human-sense feeling with the hand-written stroke. Importantly, I can easily embed the __ExcaliDraw__ diagram into my __Notion__ so that I can refer to diagram while recalling what I have read and noted. Not only for personal use, but __ExcaliDraw__ and __Lucidchart__ can also be used for the collaboration purpose such as the brainstorming session where everyone can draw at the same time. 

One important feature of these apps is that the data is synced across all devices. Thus, I don't need to spend time on replicating the data from my laptop to other devices when I want to use it.

## 4. Storage
![](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4maSf36JJYEkHv_bG50fj88qf-tMKRgn6jT5Muh5M-Zre0hbm4iyyNcECF5KZT9dOp0T8qqYWxRF6NnkdzNP9OY7jJn-2o2yzYpFs8Z0eeRSrFp-OCi1pqweFzimE48KSv4gA0sYTqt6nzQZwAG-StdVkHV5Zq8hg6OOxP1rB2tmbecggtS9LDulJM5ctnAGvf?width=1474&height=268&cropmode=none)

Storage is the place where we store all information or data such as notes, images, bookmarks, documents, digital resources, and others. When we want to search for a particular information, the first thing that we think about is the location of the information. This speeds up the process of searching for the information. Thus, storage is also considered as one important part in the productivity pipeline. For this purpose, I use __OneDrive__ and __Notion__.

I used __OneDrive__ for storing PDF documents (incl., books and research articles), images and digital resources my personal projects. Here, I tend to use the full-text search feature in __OneDrive__ which quickly finds documents that I need for my work. Furthermore, __OneDrive__ is a hybrid app which quickly synced the data from one of my devices to other devices, and I can use them offline when needed. While opening and reading a document in OneDrive, I can use the highlight and note feature to points out some key concepts in that document. Then, all highlights and notes are automatically synced to Cloud so that I don't need to worry I will lose those key concepts.

I used __Notion__ to store bookmarks, notes, knowledge base and hand-written diagrams from __ExcaliDraw__. Here, I can also create databases which hold a enormous amount of information. Each database offers handy filtering options that I can used to filter the information by tag, date, status, and more. For my convenience, I can also group multiple databases from various places into one place. Importantly, these databases will be automatically synced while I start editing them.


## 5. Automation
![](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4m9gnJlSJMd3vNPgTYhWWLHTTDkN-_-yMTu3tfv6fpB0uZrcwtPCcp1kiogYipCOr56BvX3iG0NUUIT3HN6qYovnmuSpHvu5Y3zToWuJhmLluUEN-MGsrVoEYMM7iaHDaabrDe2dsPz5TUoqiA3OKYWnTQeEK4_BlLbEwl9N4c-hE9Eb7EB0589R9cD6pLLhCW?width=1474&height=268&cropmode=none)

Automation is one way that you can reduce the time spending on a particular task but still receive the same outcome. If any digital task costs you an hour per day, you should automate it. I started using __Microsoft Power Automate__ for a while, and it saves my time on several tasks.

__Power Automate__ can be integrated with many tools such as Twitter, Outlook, Slack, OneDrive, and others. This supports me automate some tasks that I tend to do. As one example, I'm using __Power Automate__ to automatically store my highlights and notes exported from __Kindle__ into a folder in my __OneDrive__. As another example, __Power Automate__ helps me store trusted resources attached in emails in __Outlook__ into a folder that I can quickly access without downloading those resources. Perhaps, there are other good pipeline with __Power Automate__ supporting different use cases that I haven't tried. I will explore more about this once I have time. Then, I will publish a blog post for my setup as well.
