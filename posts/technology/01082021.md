"How can we manage set up the project and manage its dependencies?" is one of the most frequently asked questions before starting a software project with Python programming language. While there are various existing YouTube tutorials and blog posts discuss and present how to set up the Python project in different ways, there are a few existing content that present how we can organise a workspace for a particular Python project in such as way that multiple developers in a team can quickly set up the project and speed up their development process. In this post, I present how virtual environments such as Conda or Docker can be used for effectively organising a workspace for a Python project.

## 1. Python package-management system
Like other programming languages (e.g., Java, JavaScript or C++), Python has its own package-management system, called [package install for Python](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) (pip), which is used for installing and managing Python packages. After installing Python, you can follow the instruction in [this website](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) to install `pip`. If you has successfully installed `pip`, you can try the following command on your Terminal (macOS) or WSL (Windows).

```shell
pip --version
```

Then, you will receive `pip 20.3.1 from /usr/home/python/packages/pip` which indicates that `pip` version and the location that stores `pip` a Python package. Note that we are in the `home` folder which can be presented as the root folder of your machine. If you are trying to install new packages such as [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) and [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/), these two packages will be stored in the `packages` folder (see also Figure 1).

![Figure 1. The flow diagram showing the process of install Python packages via pip](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4mD2vAHBQWLgyQ-7pBA5fI5BX8dv5QLA2NLn32oHx3qPkTq7otIZgYvV5JzKGe_P1e3-28Gop_TkGdHdEXKBZQi6XxU0oH7o_-EuN7853_dEyUTbKn4xNMtD6Aq23S0M4WyowT4jVj6e9GhlSYv4OGYvp1ZX_hyhMhV67_QNEEB1X7DvKeu3vv9mSFp1VU8C_l?width=748&height=620&cropmode=none)

Since the Python packages are stored in the main or default `python` folder which is associated to the `home` folder, you can use the packages anywhere in your machine, and hence, this is called global environment. This is very convenient and can be reusable for many Python projects which are created on your machine. However, once we start sharing the work with other developers in a particular project, this becomes a big problem due to various reasons as: 

1. You cannot easily filter and export all necessary packages for that project and pass those packages to other developers in the team.
2. It consumes lots of time to install the large number of packages which have been installed from various projects. For example, it can take up to 100 seconds to install all packages while it only takes 10 seconds to isntall necessary ones for a particular project. This leads to the inefficiency during the software development process.

To solve this problem and improve the efficiency as well as the effectiveness of the collaboration within a team, we will need to reduce a number of packages such that we only keep necessary ones for a particular project.

## 2. Organise workspace with virtualenv

To only keep necessary packages of a particular project, we will need to use `virtualenv` which is a Python package that allows us to create a minimal or virtual environment which contains install packages for a specific project. To install and activate a new environment using `virtualenv`, you can follow the instruction in [this website](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/). If you successfully set up the environment, you will be able to achieve the folder structure as shown in Figure 2.

![Figure 2. The flow diagram showing the process of installing Python packages via virtualenv](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4mChji0ymGoLuFtj7ngd36l9nlxbkt7xc_m_mAp1jJaDrEW8TU9q3ASPczi1p2mR3IoyEYyXCkJaepSVWbradte7-TjO4_14ZbF9Cc_gDbz_e0cmMbku4HZvFUMEqdFkgYQ_vliLaFxpNtqr6zFJyS9sBp6KvP3I2RAypSof8BG0SnyqHdh9dV7ENC_Cuc3IF2?width=848&height=803&cropmode=none)

As can be seen in Figure 2, we have created a virtual environment, called `pylib`, surrounding the `ProjectA` project. In this environment, we only install two packages as `pandas` and `numpy` for this project. Therefore, we can easily make a `requirements.txt` file which contains a minimal number of packages for a specific project. To do that, you can execute the following command.

```shell
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Similarly, we can achieve the same thing with other projects such as `ProjectB`, `ProjectC`, etc. It is more effective and efficient than what we have seen in Section 1, isn't it? However, `virtualenv` also has its own disadvantages as:

1. It is only used for the development process where technical people are the main users. Setting up `virtualenv` is not a complex task but it still requires the user to has a little technical knowledge.
2. It sometimes makes the documentation for the project a bit complicated in terms of steps for setting up the project. Therefore, it is still not efficient regarding time.
3. In real world, we might have two different projects that use the same dependencies but are located in two different folders. You might think that you need to create two separate environments and install all packages. However, this approach is not efficient in terms of computer storage. Then, you might think that you do not need to create two separate environments but need to navigate to the folder containing the environment every time you start working on a particular project. However, this approach is not quite convenient.


## 3. Organise workspace with Conda

[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) is similar to `virtualenv` in terms of setting up the virtual environment for each Python project. To set up this tool, you can follow the instruction in [this website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). There are several differences between Conda and `virtualenv` as:

1. Conda allows us to put all the virtual environments in one place which is the `envs` folder under the `conda` folder as shown in Figure 3. Therefore, unlike `virtualenv`, we do not need to navigate to different places to activate a specific virtual environment.
2. We do not even need to navigate to the `envs` folder to activate the virtual environment. Instead of that, we can activate the environment for a specific project by using the following command `conda activate [environment_name]`.
3. We can use the created virtual environment for any projects that we want to run under that environment.
4. We can specify the Python version when setting up the virtual environment.

![Figure 3. The flow diagram showing the process of installing Python packages via conda](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4m9A4u_LVTPFUCe0GkZfa67aX3md9tCtrUr6T-BuaFZRlqwC8wKx2Xh4020S_-Eaz9bVNtyZMiHwk6y1zKDkzAdinM-WqgZbxdVe09VhciutbKdpyguHSrbCDbYykvUT03FdxxXb2HaRHiMBoVUjAHdUQFtX6t6dNIrgHU4Vp5JlIFpTBYV76UlS9C51ygUPSe?width=845&height=856&cropmode=none)

Conda is more effective and convenient to use than `virtualenv`, and it is required less learning experience than `virtualenv`. However, not all developers are familiar with Conda. Therefore, setting up Conda costs some extra time and efforts. This can potentially slow down the development process. Furthermore, if our goal is to hand over the project for testing purposes, Conda is not a good choice.

## 4. Organise workspace with Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a software that allows developers to build the separate virtual operating system (OS) as a container for the developed software. To install and learn more about Docker, you can follow the instruction in [this website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). Comparing to all the approach of organising the Python workspace above, Docker is the most convenient way to do so, especially when collaborating with other developers who do not have a technical background about Python.

When collaborating or handing over the project, we only need to have a `Dockerfile` for the entire project. Then, we need to build with the `docker build` command and start testing the developed software. As can be seen in Figure 4, one Docker image or container can be reusable for multiple projects, and hence, it is very convenient during the development process.

![Figure 4. The workspace for each project using Docker](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4meT-nssQMbZjo0ly3Ie-PENLF_zkEb6U4PVnN1bdITq1s7q1r60fg3v_vk17_Zalc_QsivRwEZv9CDM1efh7QOv_yXwC8nd1vx4zTl_XjaOhXWmgH-Z_TdheSu3cxw1fKnaX4BiHb8l5i4SC_7Bef0pdjRuGXGbHUbgkWLPb-STCZNDk4KqBT4DACSjh5yTgg?width=732&height=903&cropmode=none)

Although it is very convenient to use Docker during the development process, Docker has its own disadvantages as:

1. Writing `Dockerfile` for the entire architecture requires time, efforts and advanced technical knowledge in terms of Shell programming and networking.
2. We will need to re-build the Docker image as well as the Docker container every time we make changes (even the small ones) in the code. Therefore, large packages like `torch` and `nltk` (see also Figure 4) will be re-installed, and hence, it costs an extra waiting time during the development. As a result, the efficiency of the development process can be reduced for some projects.


## 5. Organise workspace with both Docker and Conda

To address the waiting time for the installation while using Docker during the development process, we can take an advantage of Conda which creates all virtual environments in one place (i.e., the `envs` folder as shown in Figure 3) for all installed packages.

1. Create and activate the virtual environment using Conda
2. Install all packages into the created environment
3. Write a Dockerfile for building a Docker image
4. Build a Docker container with the volume mounting to the `packages` folder in the created environment

![Figure 5. The flow diagram showing the process of the combination between Docker and conda](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4mQ8dSo-IT5WJSa8N6LL3pEPTGeg0At77VnyMw9Faf4-woi2839aa66EwrSu9P3K7X0-aEuyzEJTy95TIB2gkyZCQSTWbL5drTaiLIwj7VqB1V5FMsvcm1wONtsmxj-LQkpz8D1BO5POgeoHJMchrGiXv5xqCoO23lT1MrlFO2xqATXGxiOlKfUr944bJXPvh3?width=911&height=535&cropmode=none)

Figure 5 shows the entire pipeline after executing the steps above. By organising the workspace this way, we do not need to install the large chunk of packages every time we make changes to the code. Importantly, it improves the ease of development once we build multiple containers at one time and establish the communication between them using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). However, there are also some disadvantages of this approach as:

1. This is only used for the development process and not advisable for the production system as the best practice.
2. The setting process is more complicated than the other approaches above.
3. Since we couple Docker with Conda, the collaboration level between cross-functional teams is also got affected.
