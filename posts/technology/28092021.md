title: Building a Deep Learning PC for beginners
summary: Building a PC for practicing deep learning development is not an easy task because it requires you to have knowledge in both software and hardware. Unlike building a PC for gaming or office purposes, building a deep learning PC is more about finding the answer for questions that you might have for each part of the computer such as number of RAM, number of CPU threads, type of GPU, the amount of memory in GPU, and others. As a beginner, you might find difficult and time-consuming to find all pieces of information that you need to build a complete PC. Therefore, I write this blog post to share my experience when building my first deep learning PC.

Building a PC for practicing deep learning development is not an easy task because it requires you to have knowledge in both software and hardware. Unlike building a PC for gaming or office purposes, building a deep learning PC is more about finding the answer for questions that you might have for each part of the computer such as number of RAM, number of CPU threads, type of GPU, the amount of memory in GPU, and others.

## 1. Process and Useful Resources:

![Figure 1. The entire process of building a deep learning PC](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4mgo2RH0mNGLtMEqB0uzb3L72HrCQodKifPVIcq3HB5z8sBCCUgGzzqxh8VCKrQUrrFjzS4BHEO_x7MEOrTKcRfquQjLk7k2s9SOXXKAd7-bM9_tR46ufqJJg8Mnj6mUkUCLRhwqAg5u1TjoKeDghkBJ1Qz8-LSA3v7a3smA7z27o8LrPg2wiCCWE7qXTSTELg?width=1827&height=238&cropmode=none)

As shown in Figure 1, the entire process of building a deep learning PC includes 4 stages as:
1. Identify specifications for PC parts
2. Select retailers and purchase PC parts
3. Assemble PC parts
4. Set up operating system(s)

Each stage has its own challenges that you might face during the process. However, you can also learn lots of things from those challenges. I provide the description for each stage below.

üîç __Identify specifications for PC parts:__ This involves the process of understanding your needs and PC parts supporting what you are looking for. While the former is more about the deep learning tasks such as natural language processing, computer vision, speech and others that you will execute on the PC, the latter is more about finding PC parts that accelerate your task execution. In this regard, I would suggest reading two blog posts as [Hardware Guide to Deep Learning
](https://timdettmers.com/2018/12/16/deep-learning-hardware-guide/) and [Which GPU(s) to Get for Deep Learning: My Experience and Advice for Using GPUs in Deep Learning](https://timdettmers.com/2020/09/07/which-gpu-for-deep-learning/) written by Tim Dettmers. These two blog posts provide details on PC parts and reason behind GPU choice for specific deep learning tasks. Aside from the content, searching pieces of information on comments in each post is also useful.

üõí __Select retailers and purchase PC parts:__ After understanding your needs, you can use the [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/) website for selecting all PC parts and check compatibility of the entire PC. This website not only provides the information about each PC part but also the retailer who offers the cheapest price for that particular PC part. Retailers on the website can be popular ones in your living country. Therefore, if you have other retailers in your mind, you can try to use [Google Shopping](https://shopping.google.com/) to search for a particular part.

üõ† __Assemble PC parts:__ After receiving all PC parts, it's time for assembling them in a PC tower case. This process does not require you to have much knowledge about electricity but does require you to have some supporting tools such as different types of screwers, flashlight and scissor. If you don't have prior knowledge about hardware, you can go to YouTube and search for some tutorial videos that show the entire assembling process. However, to be noted that PC parts in those tutorial videos might differ from what you have. Therefore, some additional small steps might require you to pay attention to the user manual. It would be better if you search for guiding videos coming from manufacturers of your PC parts. After physically building a PC, you will need to test different PC parts by observing the displayed information in the BIOS (basic input/output system) that will popped up when you power up the PC. If every information is displayed as you expected, you have successfully assembled PC parts. Otherwise, you will need to check whether a particular part is connected properly or search for reasons on the Internet.

üñ• __Set up operating system(s):__ After successfully assembling all PC parts, you can start set up your desired operating system(s). Again, YouTube is one of the great resources that you can use to search for guidance. With Windows OS, you will need to buy a product key for activating the system. However, it's not necessary to buy its disk because the ISO image of Windows is provided in [Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/software-download/windows10). Although this is downloadable via macOS, it's advisable that you should download it from another machine with Windows OS for mitigating some mismatching issues. Similar to Windows OS, you can download Linux OS from the [Ubuntu website](https://ubuntu.com/). Unlike Windows OS, Linux OS is completely free. Therefore, you don't need to buy a product key to activate it. Furthermore, it's up to you to choose specific Linux version for your PC. After the OS is up and running, you will need to install GPU driver for using your GPU(s). Finally, everything should be ready for you to run some cool deep learning programs.

## 2. PC Parts:

In this section, I will provide reasons behind my decisions on purchasing different PC parts for my first deep learning PC. For more context, I'm interested in practicing and doing some tasks that are relevant to natural language processing, speech recognition and reinforcement learning on this PC. Therefore, my goal is to build a PC that have enough GPU power and many threads for handling those tasks. Furthermore, since this supports long-term usage, my budget for this is roughly 3k AUD which is a bit more than the average price for a deep learning PC on the market. Regarding chosen retailers, I mostly purchased PC parts from Australian local retailers such as [CentreCom](https://www.centrecom.com.au/), [PLE Computers](https://www.ple.com.au/), and [BPC Tech](https://www.bpctech.com.au/) and somewhat from [Amazon AU](https://www.amazon.com.au/).

__PCPartPicker:__ [https://au.pcpartpicker.com/list/MrkbBc](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/list/MrkbBc)

### 2.1. CPUs:

![AMD Ryzen 9 3900X Processor with Wraith Prism LED Cooler](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4m5uPDpdTgyLGqif0alrayIWH1wF3_W_-DH2T5TrJ4QdViqPwP7uLCfSDSg0mPtOxydnKu67wFRpIAWwpEW8kUNp8y6OVdT1S_5geRGa8GfsFDh8EjDF0fA1I2HEdXzfy0EakHLGEM5JRFiyOXJNdb0biVZaZd6LLizoHVwII97FtRh-H1O_rdCI7Y0aj3eW7w?width=1093&height=937&cropmode=none)

__Central Processing Unit (CPU)__ is the essential part to power up your PC. For deep learning, CPUs are mainly used for speed up different pre-processing strategies [[2](https://timdettmers.com/2018/12/16/deep-learning-hardware-guide/)]. Furthermore, after following [this series of comments](https://timdettmers.com/2018/12/16/deep-learning-hardware-guide/#comment-77787) in [[2](https://timdettmers.com/2018/12/16/deep-learning-hardware-guide/)] and doing some research, I understand that reinforcement learning tasks require many CPU cores and threads to boost the performance. Therefore, the number of cores and the number of threads need to be considered while purchasing CPUs. In this regard, I decided to buy [AMD Ryzen 9 3900X Processor with Wraith Prism LED Cooler](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SXMZLP9/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07SXMZLP9&linkCode=as2&tag=hungdu-20&linkId=4004a5c2482a5d41c7737f51a867927e) which has 12 cores and 24 threads. The reason for not choosing Intel processor is due to the limit of my budget. At the same price, AMD Ryzen processor offers more cores and threads than the Intel one. If the number of cores and the number of threads does not matter for your tasks, [AMD Ryzen 5 3600 Processor with Wraith Stealth Cooler](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07STGGQ18/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07STGGQ18&linkCode=as2&tag=hungdu-20&linkId=4c9cc9205cccabc118d268a2c0c6816f) with 6 cores, 12 threads and lower price should be enough.

### 2.2. Motherboard:

![MSI MPG B550 Gaming Edge WiFi AM4 ATX Desktop Motherboard](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4m4ruOwjUUNNrPVpabIh0ZL3YZu6TIP6JlfFvcBTkQzD_lB2jsyb5ZCWPRXqJlw9FfMwkfBe9uJF2dtoRCaNrBEunW2taLGdDPABo-5tBHslrDwnMXlYj3O745BnXnG52TeMXiWsCyoMdXznrtSe2pq8pkJXoD9SIXhUY1X3Meu_Y2kJtT8xzBkfxjalQlh7rm?width=1000&height=750&cropmode=none)

__Motherboard__ is a circuit board that connects all PC parts. A motherboard should have enough PCIe ports that connect the number of GPUs you want to run. Furthermore, if you desire to have more than one GPU, it is advisable that the chosen motherboard should have a proper space (at least 1.5 - 3cm) between each GPU in order to prevent the overheating issue for your GPUs. For my convenience, I decided to buy [MSI MPG B550 Gaming Edge WiFi AM4 ATX Desktop Motherboard](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08B4THL9P/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B08B4THL9P&linkCode=as2&tag=hungdu-20&linkId=f00254211477289ccb1b49cdcde72806) which support Wi-Fi connection. Here, to be noted that the Wireless Networking (WN) of this motherboard is Wi-Fi 6 which offer the higher data transfer speed than Wi-Fi 5. Therefore, you should check for the WN standard before deciding to buy a particular motherboard with WN.

### 2.3. RAM:

![Corsair Vengeance LPX 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR4-3200 CL16 Memory](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4mRlCMGjiz37z3NB820vUJaagsPU5WKse1LCq02h7ZC1bGCIo-28bvDxrqz2jUZb3TTOAyxRPl3r4EkFMYD3bIA15ClwOWDcWTSsoctL_ZgdfzDwNoxAkTQsUnbLHPHEsSp7fAQ3itFua1XSXZPrhDd2x6DEZ5H4yWGu_nvwCmg24bJjibv2xauW2NW0mLlQgV?width=1000&height=1000&cropmode=none)

__Random-access memory (RAM)__ is the memory of the PC that memorises the input and output (IO) data for task execution. According to some comments in [[2](https://timdettmers.com/2018/12/16/deep-learning-hardware-guide/)] and [some Reddit threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/athcg3/why_is_the_corsair_vengeance_lpx_16gb_the_most/), I found that [Corsair Vengeance LPX 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR4-3200 CL16 Memory](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RW6Z692/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07RW6Z692&linkCode=as2&tag=hungdu-20&linkId=7974c72fa2be1891ea7dcaf854254a8b) is well suited for the AMD Ryzen CPU above. In terms of the memory size, 32 GB is the standard size for an average deep learning PC because deep learning tasks tend to pre-process large chunks of data or an enormous number of small ones. One common mistake with RAM pointed out in [[2](https://timdettmers.com/2018/12/16/deep-learning-hardware-guide/)] is purchasing too high clock rate of RAM. However, the higher clock rates aren't equivalent to the faster RAM, as explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_Yt4vSZKVk) by Linus Tech Tips. Therefore, it's advisable that you should do some research about RAM before deciding to purchase it. 

### 2.4. Graphic cards:

![MSI GeForce RTX‚Ñ¢ 3070 VENTUS 3X OC](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4mkoSI9m_juKMD3QwJ_ymOE0r4NxcLzhXz_zY6YU3EqCDvjrH7ivlkUPLbytaa-3SXnvvfUFoEC_5U-zATkfa3QxzWWYAuJWK1j4dkRBBdIN5fKClfh3mAATxVVl1OhWgKqgeX277H2LOhpXdczyl3pRXLMci-Em9a2CYw7zFQg2aUQXFhiW0UWxh6YEq4CjZI?width=1024&height=820&cropmode=none)

__Graphic Processing Unit (GPU)__ is the most essential part of your deep learning PC because it affects the performance of the task execution. Basic considerations regarding graphic cards consists of number of GPUs, number of CUDA cores per GPU, memory of GPU, and its price. 

![Figure 2. The information about popular graphic cards for deep learning with its market price](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4m178kARKfaP0yFfDAqENVvYtCEQvAq2nidUA2szinsWPMv5Wat8aQfV2aiEMkCpONZG-7goNeRcC2_pS_MnV4eskN3nGlOz9E0i4x2RX_lATfL_b8MLeyIDX3memesj9qK7WRq-KlF9IlWOv-5lrDJqcmtX-tCQTLPM8Fgimv1yhQmwgzvuwXnhgcU1FrgMOn?width=884&height=326&cropmode=none)

According to [[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA)], CUDA is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface model created by NVIDA. This means that CUDA cores allows sub-tasks in a specific deep learning task to run at once. Therefore, the more CUDA cores the faster the task execution. Although NVIDIA manufactures many series of graphic cards, you can quickly grab the information about number of CUDA cores for each series of graphic cards on [their website](https://www.nvidia.com/en-au/). One example of this is that you can visit the [NVIDIA GeFore RTX 3070](https://www.nvidia.com/en-au/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3070-3070ti/) website and scroll down to see the information about CUDA cores of RTX 3070 and RTX 3070 Ti.

Memory of GPU also depends on your deep learning tasks. 8GB is the standard memory of GPU that is normally used for deep learning since less-than-8GB GPUs are too small to run even small tasks on image pre-processing, according to [[1](https://timdettmers.com/2020/09/07/which-gpu-for-deep-learning/)]. GPU with 12 GB of memory as the RTX 3060 model in Figure 2 is reasonably good and not quite expensive but you will need trade that memory advantage with those that have greater number of cores but less memory as RTX 3060 Ti, RTX 3070, and so forth. As mentioned in [[1](https://timdettmers.com/2020/09/07/which-gpu-for-deep-learning/)], 8GB of memory for the GPU is more than suitable for a case that you want to learn more about data decompression techniques or deep learning architectures that handle large-sized data such as images.

Number of GPUs matter when you are comfortable with you deep learning skills and plan to implement a massive deep learning model as some language models in natural language processing. Personally, I think 1 - 2 GPUs should be enough at the beginning of the deep learning journey. However, it's advisable that GPU types should be the same for effective parallelism [[1](https://timdettmers.com/2020/09/07/which-gpu-for-deep-learning/)]. Furthermore, multiple GPUs require a good cooling system for reducing overheating risks on them, and some best practices about the amount of space between each GPU when assembling them into the motherboard.

The price of each graphic card mainly depends on its number of cores. As you can see in Figure 2, RTX 3070 with 8GB offers 2304 more cores than RTX 3060 with 12GB, and hence, RTX 3070 is more expensive than RTX 3060. The price of a graphic card can be the most expensive one compared to other parts in your PC. Therefore, if you have a limited expense, you might need to wait for promotions from some retailers on some occasions in your locality. If you have enough budget to afford RTX 3070, you might consider between RTX 3060, RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3070 because RTX 3060 tends to have the low price from retailers. However, if memory of GPU is not important to your cases, I would suggest going with RTX 3070 due to the difference in number of cores. For example, the difference in number of cores and price between RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 is 2034 cores and 550 AUD, respectively. To afford the additional 2034 cores, you will need to pay for 950 AUD (i.e., RTX 2070). This means you will need to pay for an extra 450 AUD for 12 GB of memory that might not be worth it. 

Aside from these considerations, it would be a plus if you can further research about each GPU's architecture for your specific deep learning task(s) on NVIDIA website. Initially, I only had enough budget for RTX 3060. However, after doing some analysis above and getting the best price for [MSI GeForce RTX‚Ñ¢ 3070 VENTUS 3X OC](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08KWLMZV4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B08KWLMZV4&linkCode=as2&tag=hungdu-20&linkId=ff72c815a284a064454eaec27adfca87) from one of my local retailers, I decided to expand the budget a bit more.

### 2.5. Storage:

![Samsung 970 EVO Plus SSD 1TB - M.2 NVMe Interface Internal SSD](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4m8anHuJmO8IsgylqEGqEDZVmWLvJXS9C4Q_uyOKrsEc8hBAUtR1k3n8Q3xKvOMzY8AGlSnl_k4c8TjKL_aqRnJfJqvwFzRlFE163adHlZPsNZc6pKHU2pVhpoPJz-OK9ku14_iaZk0SveTte5nx9t8lwONh1q-6AIsNXQRVjufGzqFiivaarecQgImKTBges9?width=1500&height=683&cropmode=none)

__Storage__ is where you store operating systems and data/information from different applications. There are two types of storage such as SSD and HDD. While SSD offers the high speed of read/write operations, HDD offers the high capacity with the cheap price. 512GB of SSD and 2TB of HDD are quite standard for many deep learning PCs. When looking for SSD, it's important to look at the speed of read/write operations. So, the ideal setup has one SSD for running your applications smoothly and a large HDD for storing datasets for those applications. Since I don't have enough budget for another HDD, I only purchased [Samsung 970 EVO Plus SSD 1TB - M.2 NVMe Interface Internal SSD](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MFZY2F2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07MFZY2F2&linkCode=as2&tag=hungdu-20&linkId=9f7e66481c731a81f72c42fdb0a7dd16). However, I will extend this setup soon.

### 2.6. Power Supply:

![CORSAIR RMX Series, RM750x, Fully Modular Power Supply, 80+ Gold Certified](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4mytWF7oigt7m2mnHlMb_ld7OdK5gtrO2ijmeRgd5OHnpqKMTwmxN5O9XRtlJN9R50PyEb8aaxbBfoYRe7qOL9oVBN_RUcJIP7o40Gs-XinRAzaeA64Nkm4KSMc4FAZ-Be5Ifu-hY6O9MU00raX5n-pCjNigEPdh3vKDOuwrKfgbP2hchp-Xfvuz12LJ7PB_7m?width=1252&height=964&cropmode=none)

__Power Supply (PSU)__ is used to supply electricity to all PC parts. Based on cable management, there are three types of PSU such as non-modular, semi-modular and fully modular. Non-modular PSU has all cables that are connected to the PSU and cannot be detached. Semi-modular PSU has some cables that are connected to the PSU and other cables that are detachable. Fully modular PSU has all cables that are detachable such that you only need to attach necessary cables for the entire system. Aside from these, you also need to consider the number of watts such that the PSU is sufficient to accommodate   all PC parts. You can easily find this information in [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/). I chose [CORSAIR RMX Series, RM750x](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079HGN5QS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B079HGN5QS&linkCode=as2&tag=hungdu-20&linkId=b157421ebbe6264dccb53791309007bc) as the PSU for my system because it is the fully modular one and does not have loud fan noise.

### 2.7. Cooling System and Case:

![Cooler Master Hyper 212 RGB Black Edition CPU Cooler](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4meUTSPpRtNql58sQ3uheIL804niedpw1T-vU_XIXtIazOLDRmbg0SUrMVy5fks59-6DXGDmZ0e2Q6yVbrQZMO2_Wld4_vDAzNYzU4oVlC8GWDHKSxxvUPX-wu7ZNAnBNL5o6Rk714gSolX4Zh8RbilQDNdJ05xDdxLtmYlltYZZwz0tuaXbky9zK8TOuqr23r?width=883&height=1024&cropmode=none)

__Cooling system__ includes the cooler for the CPU and fans for cooling the entire system. Note that you don't need to buy a CPU cooler if the chosen CPU already offers the cooler along with it. I had a mistake on this due to not paying attention to the offered cooler along with the GPU. Therefore, I purchased [Cooler Master Hyper 212 RGB Black Edition CPU Cooler](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H22TC1N/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07H22TC1N&linkCode=as2&tag=hungdu-20&linkId=dade50f21a8d812c46bcb4e712fc5480). However, I did some research and found that this GPU cooler is the standard one on my local market. In terms of fans for cooling the entire system, it depends on the tower case that you choose. If the tower case already attaches fans, so you don't need to separate ones. Otherwise, you will need to look for good fans that can be sufficient to reduce the heat from the system.

![Thermaltake Versa J24 Tempered Glass RGB](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4mIf_om9uiatRiFpr_6Nkcr4CyO9dM4GrE43fFo9dniHP0g-CxNiR1cJGw17kX--SfBE_JEF46GRDi0euhXsqREw_iHCvBm9PxyCvie1Y93xGv-WSxxZmkAUSzY1cN9_-IantpfceubpzgHbEHoIpSDVCrIkeb-wAkT825KvMwRcbndr2XAUDou5yORV_cJwI1?width=720&height=720&cropmode=none)

__Tower case__ is where you put all PC parts in. When choosing a tower case, you will need to consider the size of the case such that it's adequate for all PC parts. If the size and space of the case is small, you might feel cramped when assembling PC parts. One rule of thumb is that you can buy the case supporting for the future extension of the PC. I chose [Thermaltake Versa J24 Tempered Glass RGB](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GCDLVRB/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07GCDLVRB&linkCode=as2&tag=hungdu-20&linkId=61283f6e780f2fc9faa5794ebf6d9226) because it attaches fans and moderately small for being put on my desk. However, the trade-offs of this are I feel a bit cramped when assembling PC parts, especially the PSU, and it might not support the future extension of the PC well. 

## 3. Operating Systems:

Windows OS and Linux OS are two operating systems for a PC. While Windows OS requires purchased product key to activate some functionalities in the system, Linux OS is completely free and open-source.

Windows OS is a good choice if you desire to edit or render heavy multimedia data such as videos and sounds in high quality. Furthermore, you're already familiar with [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) that is a Linux kernel running along with Windows. By using WSL, you will get a Linux-like feeling on Windows during the development. However, if you want to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to containerise your deep learning applications with GPUs via WSL, you will need to carefully configure it. In this regard, you can find the guide in [NVIDIA CUDA TOOLKIT DOCUMENTATION](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl-user-guide/index.html).

Linux OS is a good choice if you desire to have a fast and minimal OS to run your deep learning applications. Linux is faster than Windows since it has little in-built utilities, but you can still install your desired utilities. Furthermore, the availability of many open-source deep learning modules is higher under Linux than Windows (Read more via [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/92jjyz/windows_10_vs_linux_for_deep_learning/)). Containerising deep learning applications in Linux with GPUs is also more comfortable in Linux than Windows WSL. However, if you're new to Linux OS, it will take a while for learning how Linux works and various shortcuts that boost your productivity.

It's also possible for dual boosting the PC with two operating systems. Before doing this, you need to consider whether you have enough storage to maintain both systems. It's advisable to boost both systems in SSD instead of HDD to achieve the high speed of read/write operations. Furthermore, it would be better if you have two SSD drives and boost each system in the separate SSD drive. This is because it will be safer to backup all necessary data in a particular OS while another OS is damaged.
