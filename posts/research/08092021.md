Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not only the concept but it also is used for solving many real-world problems in various fields such as healthcare, business, governing, finance, education and others. Many companies start building an AI team to enable them to build AI solutions for their specific scenarios. Therefore, understanding fundamental concepts of AI enables us to further augment it to our lives. In this blog post, I present some fundamental concepts of AI, reasons why AI is popular now, roles in an AI team and six principles of AI development and use.

## 1. What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

AI is an intelligence created by human to mimic human-like behaviours such as language understanding, visual recognition, speech recognition, decision making and others. It contains a set of machine learning and deep learning techniques which can be operated together for solving a particular problem. One of the most popular examples that shows the use of AI at scale is the voice assistant application such as such as Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or others. Here, speech recognition and language understanding are applied to help a machine process human voice and understand it. According to [[1](http://35.238.111.86:8080/jspui/bitstream/123456789/274/1/McCarthy_John_What%20is%20artificial%20intelligence.pdf)], there are at least 12 branches/concepts of AI that involve in many types of applications as shown in Figure 1.

![Figure 1. 12 branches/concepts of AI and AI applications](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4mtVxG7NC1NTilsa-Qy73rkzY_8lqg32g68jfmeB_-Rh5oO9hPlnlJmNuiuLAOxvO2HmoKH2MpW4TwvMyjIrg2soXYX_V1_ahLI177Yg3AkLzp-MYBVYwLeXM6AKdVYu4DWb0tuJJdqxAwO-cVtjwg430qMm68dwLvJdSSPLPcBLj-JsqchP7mxlKI-RtXyxlr?width=1474&height=724&cropmode=none)

Aside from these, AI is also about the collaboration between human and machine in building a comprehensive intelligence that tackles real-world problems (see also Figure 2). Therefore, it is associated to the culture where people with multidisciplinary background work closely with each other to innovate AI solutions that benefit our lives. Without human factors, machine learning and deep learning are purely mathematical formulas and not used for any other purposes. On the other hand, without machines and mathematics, our innovation could be decelerated, and we could be less productive than what we are.

![Figure 2. AI is the collaboration between human and machine](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4mqiMmSSFC9PGKhqMkst_kzwz2-ZxCVF0tHDYLv73_pbVM5v76ueoEFj1Shx0X3zfJTa_lnkIho_SqNivXXMED2J792bRCkJ0Q_FaDhv_IKcqHv2i0rS3DU2HI5ITFXWrHCh9IYDsMM74NtxhfKKGO01lhTOzR6DleJziB1O2LtCP1xzrb7lET9p4yYxAbYkUM?width=1474&height=592&cropmode=none)

## 2. Why does AI become popular now?

AI is not a new concept. It was founded in 1950s [[1](http://35.238.111.86:8080/jspui/bitstream/123456789/274/1/McCarthy_John_What%20is%20artificial%20intelligence.pdf), [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)] that was more than 70 years ago. However, at that period, AI was more about academic concepts that mainly involves mathematics. Therefore, AI could not be applied in massive production like today. Thanks to the development of programming, the acceleration of hardware such as computing powers and Graphic Processing Units (GPUs), and the Internet boom leading to the fast growth in the software industry in the first decades of the 21st century, many mathematical formulas related to AI can be applied and transformed into many software applications in devices such as smart phones, laptops and PCs at scale.

The impact of AI can be seen in various fields such as healthcare, business, governing, education, financial services and others (see also Figure 3).

![Figure 3. The impact of AI in various fields](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4mhiArl1AUYIVPFSrCVG5t9PMBfVK38Wg5lnpjmIY_yRnMvYMorWSMeU_KMidk6SVt1tSX6GEZwHwEdDfxc4WfsXbThBcG1PNM8gaUaEKCQ_WkXa6Od8LJ4MSzi4zggwhe6dTTP0XnczqsqeuBjZsDWFEE1vzLZXXmn0R94FFA61ps34o30gcsgAxgRLjyiNpA?width=1474&height=450&cropmode=none)

__Healthcare:__ Computer vision is one of the most popular AI techniques in the healthcare field. This is because the public data using in this field are mainly image-like data as reported in [[3](https://svn.bmj.com/content/svnbmj/2/4/230.full.pdf)]. Furthermore, natural language understanding is mostly applied in dialogues between patients and medical experts in order to provide the patients the best services or support the diagnostic process. One of the most interesting examples is how we are developing and applying AI to enable professional care givers to learn how best to communicate with people living with dementia in Australia (see also [[4](https://www.dementia.org.au/about-us/media-centre/media-releases/dementia-australia-takes-top-tech-iawards-honours-ted-ai)]).

__Business:__ Many AI applications in this field can be classified into several categories such as intelligence support agent, productivity, and others. Regarding the intelligence support agent, applications like chatbots and search engine are dominant on the market because they help business owners maintain customer retention rate and thrive the custom acquisition. In terms of productivity, many companies applied AI to speed up the recruitment process as well as the training process, understand employees' routines, and others. Furthermore, machine learning techniques that are applied on accessible customer data provide business owners the better understanding about their customers' behaviour, and hence, further support business owners in the decision-making procedures.

__Governing:__ AI applications provide governments the statistical view of the data collected from the entire population that supports them to make decisions. Furthermore, it helps many countries reduce the opportunities for corruption. SmartHS in [[5](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/viewFile/16041/16369)] has been developed for addressing limitations of the existing Chinese e-government model such as inefficient cost savings, inadequate quality of services, ineffective task-oriented workflows and others.

__Education:__ Many AI applications slowly transform the entire education field. One of the popular examples is the growth of e-learning platforms that offer the convenient ways for students to self-learn and upskill. Transcription for each video is now the fully-automated process with speech recognition and language understanding techniques in AI [[6](https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/), [7](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech-to-text/#overview), [8](https://www.ibm.com/au-en/cloud/watson-speech-to-text)]. Other than that, reading applications powered by AI techniques improve students' reading skills via contextualised question generation, conceptualised summaries of a document, and others. Furthermore, speech recognition [[9](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-012-1073-5)] and visual understanding in AI opens the opportunities for people with dyslexia, who feel difficult to read, gain knowledge from various ways of learning. 

__Financial services:__ AI applications change the way we manage our financial assets and billings. Digital smart wallets are commonly used nowadays in either developing countries or developed countries. More and more intelligent agents are created in order to support investors to manage their portfolios. Risk assessment companies start applying AI to comprehensive read documents and boost their productivity in generating financial statement of advice to their clients.

## 3. Roles in an AI team

![Figure 4. Multidisciplinary skills in building AI solutions](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4mTtdZa6LFHBcZ_KrA7FyfSibfz68LJiEw09hCK1wG9k2KFJTpPEc6GhbIe8tt1p2CZ9GWz-PrMiX0gDqWre-PyNQgVy_yzz405xY-sT5-wmP05LDuT4VzcgRfmo5Sy6rAtPf40txGM3Y9RkgsIiEMuKCzgUl6jaLOZj8GUH3L7J_OJl8tC0jUTFEcPcAS2FgU?width=1474&height=572&cropmode=none)

Architecting and building AI solutions require the involvements of many people who come from various departments and have different skillsets. This can be categorised into three aspects as below.

__IT Skills:__ Software engineer, hardware engineer and data engineer are roles that have a deep technical knowledge in engineering the entire AI solutions. Their jobs mainly focus on technology stacks that support various aspects such as prototyping, scalability, extensibility, reliability, and others. They do not need to have a comprehensive background in mathematics to complete tasks in their jobs.

__AI Skills:__ Data scientist, data analyst and ML/AI researcher are roles that have a deep technical knowledge in modelling AI solutions via concepts and mathematical proofs. Their jobs mainly focus on identifying approaches with AI and ML models that solve a specific scenario such as voice recognition, object detection, language understanding and others. In some cases, the approaches might not need to be novel but they need to solve the proposed problem. These roles might require comprehensive background in mathematics and low-level understanding about programming so that they can quickly conduct their experiments or hypotheses. 

__Domain understanding:__ Doctors, educators, farmers, artists, and other non-technical roles contribute their domain knowledge to the process of building AI solutions. For example, psychologists contribute their knowledge about mental health to the process of building an AI solution addressing a particular mental illness. Moreover, teachers explain different teaching methods to the process of building a human-centred AI solution that augment the traditional ways of teaching.

## 4. What is machine learning?

Machine learning is the learning process of a machine via mathematical or statistical models that __transform__ an input data into certain types of patterns. These patterns can be used for various purposes such as predicting the market price of a particular product, classifying a type of disease based on patient's symptoms, grouping customers by their demographic information. As shown in Figure 5, machine learning models can be classified into two learning methods such as supervised learning and unsupervised learning that consist of three goals as regression (to predict), classification (to classify), and clustering (to group). The brief description for each learning methods is as below:

![Figure 5. Types of machine learning models](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4mJrmulQMoHZAe9CDsotNpsYDl7qcM66h5orMMiPnKthRks1R1g9FkumT-HTTpFR0g0DYAdEXRs3L4mUWAKwoGpFIU_bK3XZ0lvZ3VRX0f12KzJ260gvv6gz2juGOVPY7ZI-uk2xjMLO3GpdkIK5Hq582z-qR0w3s7D3E41Ziw2OqWshvoShq0OGQYVzqNzBuO?width=1474&height=846&cropmode=none)

__Supervised Learning:__ This is a learning mechanism where a machine learns from labelled data to generate a prediction or to automatically classify a new data into a specific label. For example, we can train a machine to predict the price of a house based on its characteristics such as its age, number of bedrooms, its square footage and others. As another example, we can train a machine to classify whether a customer is happy or not after purchasing a particular product based on his/her rating or feedback on that product.

__Unsupervised Learning:__ This is a learning mechanism where a machine discovers patterns of a given data that does not have proper labels. For example, we can train a machine to group patients who suffered from heart attack based on their age and caffeine consumption per month.

## 5. Deep learning and its applications

Deep learning is the advanced technique that a machine uses to comprehensively learn about a particular object or language. Here, the neural network architecture in Figure 6 is a high-level representation of the deep learning process of a machine. Many deep learning models are listed under the classification branch because they are mainly used for classifying objects into the appropriate label via their features or details. There are also unsupervised deep learning models that are used for anomaly detection, structured prediction and others.

![Figure 6. A neural network architecture](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4m-WDw7rOqg50-bI4_huSOcbxXj1FckkRbNGHelGJ3cr_tOeqbJ1nieibcKEj34-ZDQy_Tw7UE4s3b5-bWODzIWFiEaPHcDNEHzi1MTSluAGNM35elVfK9QYKutpwd0jtElewQTRs8hMakz91vJqJvy_jfUpTxoQK9YJVBdHqAuiQpRo79QmutlOLA5fQC4FaO?width=1474&height=646&cropmode=none)

Recently, there are many deep learning applications in various domains such as visual understanding, language understanding, speech recognition, object detection, and others. Regarding visual understanding, a machine not only learns how to classify an image but also learns how to interpret that image to human language. Chatbot is one of the most popular applications of deep learning in language understanding. Voice assistant is the combination of deep learning models in both speech recognition and language understanding domains.

## 6. Principles for AI development and use

Building an AI application is interesting and complicated. Putting that application in the mass production where many people can access it is challenging and needs to follow some standards. According to [[10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/responsible-ai-principles/4-guiding-principles)], there are six guiding principles for AI development and use as follows:

![Figure 7. Six AI development and use](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4m_TmGMDGf4XWQiUZejvuvYXYvGf_IB4eSFa9VMpmdcneNDyUv7Z03SSBLyLu80R7EAioZkbh2Gmg94jURqNMDZQILZmnLNkMzf3cUsFUKoE3sbF6W-Ou6b9vx1USydO_FnkVee08fMxqH3PWo-qVr2vC3B_qZKjHUUDGYezHXzGEbwC4j2KbwO-ChuWdQ4JNm?width=450&height=450&cropmode=none)

* __Fairness:__ A developed AI system should treat everyone equally and avoid affecting similarly situated groups of people in different ways. 
* __Reliability and safety:__ A developed system should be trustful, safe to use and consistent over the time. Unexpected results generated from AI components should be handled carefully such that it is not harmful to consumers. These are critical points that helps AI products trusted by consumers.
* __Privacy and security:__ A developed AI system must protect privacy and security threats that are harmful to critical personal and information. Furthermore, it must be highly available such that users can access their own data anytime without interruption.
* __Inclusiveness:__ AI should be accessible for everyone with different health status, levels of education, genders and others. An AI product should be diversified such that it can be extended with different purposes.
* __Transparency:__ Results generated by AI components should be understandable and interpretable. This is critical for augmenting AI with human decision-making process.
* __Accountability:__ Stakeholders who involves in building an AI solution should follow best practices in development and maintenance. All AI functions should be cross-checked before deploying them into the production so that it can potentially mitigate unexpected risks.
